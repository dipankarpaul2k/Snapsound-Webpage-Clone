# Website Clone

This repository contains a web development project where I attempted to clone a beautiful and simple website that I came across. The purpose of this project was to learn web development by closely replicating an existing website.

## Background

As someone who has been learning web development for the past few days, I wanted to challenge myself and apply my newly acquired skills to a practical project. I stumbled upon a website that I found visually appealing and straightforward, and I decided to recreate it as closely as possible.

## Project Experience

Building this website clone has been an enriching experience for me. Throughout the process, I encountered numerous challenges and roadblocks. However, I persisted and overcame these obstacles by actively seeking help from online resources such as Google and YouTube videos.

## Learning Journey

Undertaking this project has allowed me to gain valuable insights and improve my web development skills. Through researching, experimenting, and troubleshooting, I have acquired a deeper understanding of various web technologies and concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of the website.
- `style.css`: A directory containing CSS files for styling the website.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository and project.

## Usage

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The website should display the cloned version of the original site, showcasing my efforts in replicating its design and functionality.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the original website (https://www.snapsound.com/) that inspired this project. Their design served as an excellent learning resource and a source of inspiration for my web development journey.
